# DictonaryDungeon
Quin's first roguelike (about alphabet magicians).

The main idea is that you are exploring a 26-deep dungeon corresponding to letters of the alphabet.

You use letters as magic by:
-breaking up items to get raw materials (letters) for your spells (or using the items as-is if you choose)
-creating items you've unlocked from leveling by spelling them with raw-material letters you have
-killing enemies either by bumping into them like normal, or casting a spell to 1-hit kill them if you have the letters

the power of objects and monsters might be based off of how high it would score in scrabble (not sure yet)

I've never made a multi-file game or a roguelike before, so it's very possible this project will fail pathetically.
